So if we split our model into 5 parts, then the second part can't start until the first part is done, the third part can't start until the second part is done, and so on.

        "Alright, so after learning about how pipeline parallelism works, you might think \"Cool, I got this!\". But hold on a sec, because there's a lot more to it. Setting up pipeline parallelism, like using GPipe, can get pretty complex and bring up some tricky problems to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about having a bunch of devices working together. They need to talk to each other, right? But if they're not careful about when and how they communicate, they might end up waiting on each other even when they don't really need to. That's kind of like being on a group chat where everyone needs to wait for one person to respond before they can keep talking. Not so fun, huh?\n",
        "\n",
        "Then there's the problem of skip connections. That's when a layer in the model gets to skip ahead and pass its stuff directly to a layer further down the line. It's like being able to skip a question on a test and come back to it later. But how does we figure out which parts are the skip connections and get them where they need to go?\n",
        "\n",
        "And how do we even decide how to split the model into partitions in the first place? Not all layers are the same. Some might need more memory than others, so we can't just split the model evenly. It's like dividing up chores at home, but some chores take longer than others. If we're not careful, some devices might run out of memory, while others are sitting around twiddling their thumbs.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's also a tricky issue with how PyTorch works. In pipeline parallelism, we need to make sure that the backward pass (that's when the model is learning from its mistakes) on one device finishes before the backward pass on the previous device starts. But PyTorch isn't aware of this requirement. So how do we make sure this happens?\n",
        "\n",
        "And what about gradient checkpointing? That's a technique where we save some intermediary results so we can use them later, like keeping your place in a book with a bookmark. But this can get complicated because we're only building the computational graph (that's like the roadmap of how our data moves through the model) during the forward pass, not the backward pass. So how do we schedule these checkpoints?\n",
        "\n",
        "Even more, what happens if a node (another term for device) crashes or stops working? How do we get back to where we were before the crash? And can all the nodes get back to the same point at the same time?\n",
        "\n",
        "And there's even more! In a big cluster (that's a group of devices working together), we're not the only ones running experiments. Other teams are too. So what happens if another team needs some of the resources that we're using? How can we add and remove nodes dynamically for our training task without messing everything up?\n",
        "\n",
        "And guess what? This isn't even the half of it! You only truly get the full picture when you roll up your sleeves and start building these things from the ground up. So, here's a heads up for our next tutorial: We're gonna build something called a Multi-Processing Unit (MPU) in Megatron from scratch. It's kind of like the boss of your GPU, telling it where to send stuff for different types of parallelism - like tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism. Think of it like a traffic cop, directing the flow of data.\n",
