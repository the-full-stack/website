    "- Broadcast: We start with a tensor in one process and send it to all the other processes within the group. This is like sharing a piece of information with everyone in the group.\n",
    "- Scatter: We take a tensor from one process and distribute its elements or chunks to all the other processes in the group. This is like dividing up a task among all the members in a team.\n",
    "- Gather: We gather data from all the processes in the group and assemble it into a single tensor at the destination process. This is like collecting everyoneâ€™s input and putting it together in one place.\n",
    "- Reduce: We take data from all processes in the group, apply a specific operation to it (like summing, multiplying, finding the minimum or maximum), and then store the result in the destination process. This is like combining everyoneâ€™s efforts and producing a single output\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we canâ€™t just directly use these operations from PyTorch like `torch.distributed.broadcast`. This is because in training, letâ€™s say we are broadcasting a tensor `x` from device 0 to all devices 1, 2, and 3 during the forward pass. We must also support the reverse order during the backward pass. This means we have to write a broadcast operation that can handle both forward and backward passes.\n"

After everyoneâ€™s done their calculations, they pool together their gradients. Each gradient represents the best direction to adjust the weight to minimize the loss with respect to its mini-batch. What we want is to find an average direction that works best for all the model replicas, so we pool all these gradients together (`torch.distributed.all_reduce()`). Then, we use this big pooled gradient to tweak the modelâ€™s parameters, making it a bit better with each cycle."
